・Project Background / Client requirements
I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the
system.
I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
out-for-delivery, delivered.
When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
I need to receive regular software updates.

・How did you meet the client brief? 
I built an app that allows for a colection of couriers and orders to be stored in an sql database and orders to be saved to a local csv file.
The app allows the client to update the orders, product and couriers with ease in an easy to use terminal UI.
The app is built using an easy to read class based system that can be upgraded with relative ease and suports update using git version control.
・How did you guarantee the client requirements? 
I built unit tests for all the file handeling parts of the orders to make sure they are working as expected.
・If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon? 
I would build a more readable gui for the clients to reduce the possibility of user error through miss input.
・What did you most enjoy implementing? 
I most enjoyed building the class structure for menu handaling in the terminal.
